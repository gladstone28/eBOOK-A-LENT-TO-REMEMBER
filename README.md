Chapter 1: Introduction – A Family’s Journey Through Lent

(Scene opens in the Brown family's home in Kingston, Jamaica. It is the evening before Ash Wednesday, and the family is gathered in the living room, discussing Lent.)

MOTHER (Janice Brown): Alright, family! Tomorrow is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. This year, we’re going to make it special.

FATHER (Michael Brown): Yes! We’re not just giving up things—we’re going to use this time to grow closer to God and share His love with others.

DAUGHTER 1 (Lisa, 16): You mean we’re actually going to tell people about Jesus? Like, outside the house?

DAUGHTER 2 (Tasha, 13): Sounds cool! But… scary.

DAUGHTER 3 (Nia, 9): Will we still get bun and cheese on Easter?

(The family laughs.)

MOTHER: Of course, Nia! But first, we’re going to make some sacrifices. Let’s talk about what each of us will give up for Lent and what we will do differently.

FATHER: I’ll be fasting from social media during the day and using that time to read the Bible and pray for people.

LISA: I’ll give up my favorite snack—cheese puffs—and spend that money helping someone in need.

TASHA: I think I’ll give up watching TV after school and use that time to visit the elderly in our church.

NIA: Umm… I will share my toys with my friends!

MOTHER: That’s wonderful! And as a family, we’ll go out every Saturday to share the love of Jesus with our community. Are we ready for this?

ALL: Yes!

(Lights fade as the family bows their heads in prayer, marking the beginning of their Lenten journey.)
